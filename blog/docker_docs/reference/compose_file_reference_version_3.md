## volumes

Mount host paths or named volumes, specified as sub-options to a service.

You can mount a host path as part of a definition for a single service, and there is no need to define it in the top level `volumes` key.

But, if you want to reuse a volume across multiple services, then define a named volume in the top-level `volumes` key. Use named volumes with services, swarms, and stack files.
